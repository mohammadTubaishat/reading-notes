# HTML :

X HTML pages are text documents.
X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
X Tags are often referred to as elements.
X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.

X DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you 
are using.
X You can add comments to your code between the 
<!-- and --> markers.
X The id and class attributes allow you to identify 
particular elements.
X The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group 
block-level and inline elements together.

 

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
different parts of a web page and help to describe 
its structure.
X The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple <div> elements).
X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.
